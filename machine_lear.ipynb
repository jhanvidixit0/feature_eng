        "\n",
        "1. Understand the Dataset\n",
        "Identify data structure: EDA helps you understand the shape, size, and structure of your dataset, such as the number of rows, columns, and data types.\n",
        "Learn about variable distributions: Visualizing and summarizing data provides insights into how each variable is distributed, including detecting skewness and potential outliers.\n",
        "2. Detect and Handle Missing Values\n",
        "Find missing data: EDA helps identify missing values in the dataset, which can significantly impact model performance if not addressed.\n",
        "Choose imputation methods: Based on EDA findings, you can decide how to handle missing data, such as imputation, deletion, or using algorithms that handle missing values natively.\n",
        "3. Identify Outliers\n",
        "Outliers can distort model predictions and may indicate errors or anomalies in the data. EDA helps visualize outliers through techniques like boxplots and histograms, enabling you to decide whether to keep, transform, or remove them.\n",
        "4. Assess Relationships Between Variables\n",
        "Correlation analysis: Identify relationships between features and the target variable to determine which features are most relevant.\n",
        "Multicollinearity: Detect highly correlated features that might degrade model performance, especially in linear models.\n",
        "5. Feature Selection and Engineering\n",
        "Understand feature importance: EDA can guide which features are likely to be significant and which may need transformation or removal.\n",
        "Create new features: Discover patterns or insights that can help create derived features to enhance model performance.\n",
        "6. Detect Data Quality Issues\n",
        "Identify inconsistencies, such as incorrect data types, duplicate rows, or invalid entries, which could hinder the model training process.\n",
        "7. Choose Appropriate Models and Techniques\n",
        "Insights from EDA, such as the presence of non-linear relationships, class imbalance, or outliers, guide the choice of algorithms and preprocessing techniques."
